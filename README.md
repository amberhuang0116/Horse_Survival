Horse Survival Analysis


Horses are a beloved working animals as well as the occasional pet. With any animal that people take care of, we want them to live a long healthy life. There can be a lot of factors that affect the longevity of a horse’s life, especially once they’re taken to the vet for a present issue. On the website Kaggle, there’s a dataset titled “Horse Survival Dataset” that outlines various medical conditions and whether or not the horse was able to survive once it was taken to the vet. Some of the factors include age, whether the horse was treated with surgery, mucous membrane color, abdomen fluid color, and 23 other attributes that all contribute to whether or not the horse survived. This is important data for veterinarians who rely on their success rate of helping horses survive in order to get and keep clients.


The question we are trying to answer is, based on this dataset, which factor(s) link to horse survival the most. Specifically, how do factor(s) associate with the survival rates for horses. We are planning to clean the dataset: exclude all impossible values (may replace them with column mean or other data cleaning method). Then analyze the above topic and predict certain future events.
